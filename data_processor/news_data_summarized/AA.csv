Aluminum prices in China, it is said, rose $140 per ton last week as its economy reopens for business post-pandemic. Given that performance and the uncertainty over how long prices in China might remain high enough to offer bumper profits, I'd be leery of jumping onto this train."

Shareholders of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.3% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $45 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.80 bid, which annualizes to an additional 5.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 5.5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $45 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AA shares would have to climb 35.1% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 43.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called."
